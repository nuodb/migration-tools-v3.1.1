# migration-tools-v3.1.1
The Migrator utility (documented here http://doc.nuodb.com/Latest/Default.htm#NuoDB-Migrator.htm) no longer functions in NuoDB v3.2.x and v3.3.x releases and will be fixed in a future release. The workaround is to revert to the migrator utility that was released in v3.1.1.

To Install on Linux: 
1. Download the migrator-3.1.1-linux.tar file
2. Copy the file to your NuoDB home directory (e.g. /opt/nuodb)
3. Unpack the tar file
    tar -xvf migrator-3.1.1-linux.tar
